## Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
### Project Overview
**This Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to analyze audio files and predict the emotion expressed in speech. By utilizing audio features such as MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), this model detects and classifies emotions into categories like happy, sad, angry, etc. The model achieved 98% accuracy without hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.**

### Features
**Emotion Detection: Classifies emotions in speech such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.
High Accuracy: Achieved 98% accuracy.
Audio Processing: Utilizes MFCC and other features for emotion recognition.
Model: Classification model for emotion recognition in speech.**

### Dataset
**This project is based on a publicly available dataset for speech emotion recognition, consisting of labeled audio files representing various emotions.**

### Installation
#### Clone the repository:
**bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Manikandan200355/Zidio_DataScience_Internship.git
cd speech-emotion-recognition**

### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
**bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`**

### Install the required dependencies:
**bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt**

### Usage
**Training the Model: To train the emotion recognition model, you can run the following command:
bash
Copy code
python train.py**

### Testing the Model: To evaluate the model on test data:
**bash
Copy code
python test.py**

### Making Predictions: You can predict emotions in a speech file using the trained model:
**bash
Copy code
python predict.py --file path_to_audio_file.wav**

### Preprocessing
**The audio files are preprocessed by extracting MFCC features. These features help capture the essential aspects of speech signals.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets before model training.**

### Model Architecture
**A classification model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or other suitable architecture) is used for recognizing emotions.
Features like MFCC, Chroma, and Mel-spectrograms are extracted from the audio files.**

### Results
**Accuracy: The model achieved 98% accuracy without hyperparameter tuning.
Confusion Matrix: Displays the correct and incorrect predictions for each emotion category.**

### Future Work
**Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve accuracy.
Extend the model to support real-time emotion recognition.
Experiment with other deep learning architectures to boost performance.**
